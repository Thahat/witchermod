For both: adjust fuel requiring recipes...
-----------nordlings:-----------
adjust shield on wall collision boxes.
possibly re-try the wall hanging shield thing again.
-possibly invert tents position so people sleep to the outside? might be more cosey?
wooden fire wood holders like the ACE metal ones


------witcher to do/fix:-----------
- check if workers level
	- check their skillset on levelup and fix up what is needed
	
-worker abillities are currently invisible. check nordlingmod for fix?	

-initiate and witcher helmets still WIP, recipes need to be done.

-doublecheck if initaites have building AI?

-change initiate description to explain they do the trapping.

-in promotion tree it still says worker instead of acolyte?

-possibly for the mage, some way do do research? recipe that takes nothing and gives nothing at his table? see if there is a reading anim somewhere?

-might want to put mages behind a questline eventually.

-change recipe requirements from mage items

-add fibre drop to destruction of training dummy? or alternatively, easier acces to fibre for all? treebark fibre?

-Hair: rivian ponytail?

-move gem crushing to blacksmith

possible risky witcher transformation:

Well, ACE can sort it out 
next version will come with a buff functionality that basically gives you the option to have a timer every X time try to apply an Y buff with a Z chance (from another buff)

so you could have a buff for the transformation process that once expired could apply a different buff (the full witcher benefits buff) ((base game functionality)

but then you have the ACE functionality have a X chance to apply the "failure" buff before the timer expires, that failure buff could "remove" the process buff and just be a permanently quick damage over time buff that will cause them to despair and die
